        Portfolio Reflection</p>
        <p>
        I am interested in going into the journalism industry. I am hoping to work as a multimedia journalist, 
        but this class had definitely made me interested in doing more work with data and/or web-design. I am  
        more used to mag design. </p>
        <p>
        For this portfolio, I want to showcase more of the more advanced html skills I've learned. Most of these 
        will probably be tiny details that enhance user experience w the website. I also want to do a story with 
        data so that I can also use Flourish again. I will be putting some of my old work to also make it really feel
        like a portfolio. Although I already have a portfolio, this website makes it feel more impressive because 
        I am building everything brick by brick.
        <p>
        I did not use any AI in the making of this portfolio. All work is my own.
