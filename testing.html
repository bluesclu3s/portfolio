            The Problem with Standardized Testing</h2>

        <p> Chicago Public Schools are starting to prepare students for standardized testing, the earliest of which can occur in the first week of March. Standardized testing is mandated by the Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA, which requires states to assess student learning attainment for English language arts (ELA), mathematics and science. </p>

        <p> Grades 3-8 will be taking the Illinois Assessment of Reading (IAR) from Mar. 3 to Apr. 18, depending on whether the school offers the online or the physical version. Grades 5 and 8 will be required to take the Illinois Science Assessment from Mar. 3 to Apr. 30. </p>
        <p> Scores are supposed to indicate a school's performance, which can be used by the Illinois Board of Education or policymakers to make changed to curriculum or funding. Teachers also then can use the information to shape the pace and learning in their own classrooms. </p>
        <p> However, even with these percieved benefits, most educators feel that standardized testing negatively impacts their classroom. An over-emphasis on testing and "accountability" can lead to prioritizing scores over meaningful learning. </p>
        <p> According to reports by the National Education Association, standardized testing is ineffective at gauging specific topics that need more support and inequitable due to its legacy of racial bias, disproportionately affecting students from marginalized backgrounds. </p>
        <p> These scores are not an accurate reflection of academic performance and students who don't have the time or resources to prepare for standardized testing may perform "worse." </p>

        <p> A closer look at IAR data shows this phenomenon clearly. Despite Black and Hispanic students making up majority of CPS, only a small amount of students "meet" or "exceed" standards. This is not to discredit the students, but to show the sweeping impact and inefficieny of the tests in measuring academic performance.</p>
        <p> When there is an over-emphasis on testing performance, it can cause rippling effects on communities. Historically, Chicago has had sweeping school closures that mostly affect disenfranchised students on the South and West sides.</p>
        <p> In 2013, the school board voted to close 50 public schools in Chicago under the promise of then-Mayor Raum Emmanuel to send students to "better schools,"" and save money by stopping the maintenance of aging buildings. </p>
        <p> A study by <a href="https://consortium.uchicago.edu/publications/school-closings-chicago-understanding-families-choices-and-constraints-new-school">UChicago in 2015</a> showed that while 93% of students went to a school that performed better, the difference was not marginal. A quarter of the students who were displaced went to schools that performed lower than the welcoming schools assigned to them by the district. </p>
        <p> While educators, students and social workers have advocated for the end of standardized testing, there is a need for more advocacy in dismantling this dated system.</p>
