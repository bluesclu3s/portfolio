        The Problem with Standardized Testing</h2>

        <p>data</p>
        <p> CPS schools are starting to prepare students for standardized testing, the earliest of which can occur in the first week of March. Standardized testing is mandated by the Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA, which requires states to assess student learning attainment for English language arts (ELA), mathematics and science. </p>
        <p> Grades 3-8 will be taking the exam Illinois Assessment of Reading (IAR) from Mar. 3 to Apr. 18, depending on whether the school offers the online or the physical version. Grades 5 and 8 will be required to take the Illinois Science Assessment from Mar. 3 to Apr. 30. </p>
        <p> Scores are supposed to indicate a school's performance, which can be used by the Illinois Board of Education or policymakers to make changed to curriculum or funding. Teachers also then can use the information to shape the pace and learning in their own classrooms. </p>
        <p> However, even with these percieved benefits, most educators feel that standardized testing negatively impacts their classroom. An over-emphasis on testing and "accountability" can lead to making scores the most important outcome. </p>
        <p> Standardized testing are also used against students from marginalized backgrounds. These scores are not an accurate reflection of academic performance, so students who don't have the time or resources to prepare for standardized testing compared to affluent communities may perform "worse." </p>
        <p> When there is an over-empahsis on testing performance, it can cause rippling effects on communities. Historically, Chicago has had sweeping school closures that mostly affect disenfranchised students on the South and West sides.</p>
        <p> In 2013, the school board voted to close 50 public schools in Chicago under the promise of then-Mayor Raum Emmanuel to send students to "better schools,"" and save money by stopping the maintenance of aging buildings. </p>
        <p> A study by <a href="https://consortium.uchicago.edu/publications/school-closings-chicago-understanding-families-choices-and-constraints-new-school">UChicago in 2015</a> showed that while 93% of students went to a school that performed better, the difference was not marginal. A quarter of the students who were displaced went to schools that performed lower than the welcoming schools assigned to them by the district. </p>
